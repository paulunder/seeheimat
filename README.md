### About

Seeheimat | alps ~ wellness is a business concept that offers wellness wellness treatments, gastro and accommodation all in one place - Seeheimat - translated from German means "home at the lake". The business is not existent right now but the concept is to offer a place where people can relax, eat and sleep all in one place. The business is located in the alps so the name is fitting for the location.
